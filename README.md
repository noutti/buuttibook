# BuuttiBook app

This program was made using React and Node.js and MongoDB.

### Node.js can be installed from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

### For the database implementation to work, you need to have a MongoDB server running on your local computer! It can be installed from https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community?tck=docs_server

```
git clone git@github.com:noutti/buuttibook.git

cd buuttibook/frontend

```
